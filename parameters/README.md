Two different parameter structures are saved in this folder. <br>
 <br>
parameters_XY_laplace_YZ.mat contain the optimized parameter sets for data set XY (either HUA, mock or mockHUA = joint) for model YZ (e.g. HUA_d1d2d3_r1r2r3 meaning the model does not contain cell-cycle but allows up to three methylation and three demethylation rate constants) For more information please see [/master_script.m](/master_script.m).  <br>
 <br>
 parametersSamplesX_Y.mat contain the MCMC chains of model hypothesis X for model Y.
